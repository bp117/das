As for interest rate swaps, the Company has one with an initial notional amount of $500 million, which will decrease to $350 million in April 2022. This swap was designed to alleviate the impact of adverse interest rate fluctuations.

interest rate swap

As of March 27, 2021, the company had an interest rate swap with an initial notional amount of $500 million that will decrease to $350 million in April 2022. This swap was designed as a cash flow hedge to mitigate the impact of adverse interest rate fluctuations for a portion of the Company’s variable-rate debt equal to the notional amount of the swap. The interest rate swap converts the one-month Adjusted LIBOR interest rate on these borrowings to a fixed interest rate of 0.237% through December 2022. When an interest rate swap agreement qualifies for hedge accounting as a cash flow hedge, the changes in the fair value are recorded in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. During Fiscal 2021, the company recorded an immaterial amount of interest expense related to this agreement.
