 The Solar System

Our solar system consists of the Sun and all the celestial objects that are gravitationally bound to the Sun. This includes the eight planets and their moons, the dwarf planets, and countless asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.

Planets

There are eight recognized planets in our solar system. They are, in order from the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Each of these planets has its own unique characteristics. For example, Venus is known as the hottest planet, while Jupiter is the largest.

Dwarf Planets

Apart from the main planets, there are also a number of dwarf planets. The most well-known of these is Pluto, which was once considered the ninth planet of the solar system until its reclassification in 2006. Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Ceres are other recognized dwarf planets.

Asteroids and Meteoroids

Asteroids are small rocky objects that orbit the Sun. Most asteroids are found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Meteoroids, on the other hand, are smaller rocks or particles that are in orbit around the Sun. When a meteoroid enters the Earth's atmosphere and burns up, it's called a meteor. If it survives the journey through the atmosphere and lands on the Earth's surface, it's known as a meteorite.

Comets

Comets are icy bodies that release gas or dust. They are often compared to dirty snowballs. As they approach the Sun, comets can develop a glowing coma (or atmosphere) and sometimes a tail. The tail always points away from the Sun due to the solar wind.
